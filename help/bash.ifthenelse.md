Bash test and comparison functions: test, [, [[, ((, and if-then-else
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Tests

   In any programming language, after you learn how to assign values to
   variables and pass parameters, you need to test those values and
   parameters. In shells, the tests set the return status, which is the
   same thing that other commands do. In fact, test is a builtin command!

test and [

   The test builtin command returns 0 (True) or 1 (False), depending on
   the evaluation of an expression, expr. You can also use square
   brackets: test expr and [ expr ] are equivalent. You can examine the
   return value by displaying $?; you can use the return value with && and
   ||; or you can test it using the various conditional constructs that
   are covered later in this tip.

Listing 1. Some simple tests

[ian@pinguino ~]$ test 3 -gt 4 && echo True || echo false
false
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ "abc" != "def" ];echo $?
0
[ian@pinguino ~]$ test -d "$HOME" ;echo $?
0

   In the first example in Listing 1, the -gt operator performs an
   arithmetic comparison between two literal values. In the second
   example, the alternate [ ] form compares two strings for inequality. In
   the final example, the value of the HOME variable is tested to see if
   it is a directory using the -d unary operator.

   You can compare arithmetic values using one of -eq, -ne, -lt, -le, -gt,
   or -ge, meaning equal, not equal, less than, less than or equal,
   greater than, and greater than or equal, respectively.

   You can compare strings for equality, inequality, or whether the first
   string sorts before or after the second one using the operators =, !=,
   <, and >, respectively. The unary operator -z tests for a null string,
   while -n or no operator at all returns True if a string is not empty.

   Note: the < and > operators are also used by the shell for redirection,
   so you must escape them using \< or \>. Listing 2 shows more examples
   of string tests. Check that they are as you expect.

Listing 2. Some string tests

[ian@pinguino ~]$ test "abc" = "def" ;echo $?
1
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ "abc" != "def" ];echo $?
0
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ "abc" \< "def" ];echo $?
0
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ "abc" \> "def" ];echo $?
1
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ "abc" \<"abc" ];echo $?
1
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ "abc" \> "abc" ];echo $?
1

   Some of the more common file tests are shown in Table 1. The result is
   True if the file tested is a file that exists and that has the
   specified characteristic.

   CAPTION: Table 1. Some common file tests

   Operator             Characteristic
   -d       Directory
   -e       Exists (also -a)
   -f       Regular file
   -h       Symbolic link (also -L)
   -p       Named pipe
   -r       Readable by you
   -s       Not empty
   -S       Socket
   -w       Writable by you
   -N       Has been modified since last being read

   In addition to the unary tests above, you can compare two files with
   the binary operators shown in Table 2.

   CAPTION: Table 2. Testing pairs of files

   Operator                             True if
   -nt      Test if file1 is newer than file 2. The modification date is used
            for this and the next comparison.
   -ot      Test if file1 is older than file 2.
   -ef      Test if file1 is a hard link to file2.

   Several other tests allow you to check things such as the permissions
   of the file. See the man pages for bash for more details or use
   help test to see brief information on the test builtin. You can use the
   help command for other builtins too.

   The -o operator allows you to test various shell options that may be
   set using set -o option, returning True (0) if the option is set and
   False (1) otherwise, as shown in Listing 3.

Listing 3. Testing shell options

[ian@pinguino ~]$ set +o nounset
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ -o nounset ];echo $?
1
[ian@pinguino ~]$ set -u
[ian@pinguino ~]$ test  -o nounset; echo $?
0

   Finally, the -a and -o options allow you to combine expressions with
   logical AND and OR, respectively, while the unary ! operator inverts
   the sense of the test. You may use parentheses to group expressions and
   override the default precedence. Remember that the shell will normally
   run an expression between parentheses in a subshell, so you will need
   to escape the parentheses using \( and \) or enclosing these operators
   in single or double quotes. Listing 4 illustrates the application of de
   Morgan's laws to an expression.

Listing 4. Combining and grouping tests

[ian@pinguino ~]$ test "a" != "$HOME" -a 3 -ge 4 ; echo $?
1
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ ! \( "a" = "$HOME" -o 3 -lt 4 \) ]; echo $?
1
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [ ! \( "a" = "$HOME" -o '(' 3 -lt 4 ')' ")" ]; echo $?
1

(( and [[

   The test command is very powerful, but somewhat unwieldy given its
   requirement for escaping and given the difference between string and
   arithmetic comparisons. Fortunately, bash has two other ways of testing
   that are somewhat more natural for people who are familiar with C, C++,
   or JavaÂ® syntax.

   The (( ))compound command evaluates an arithmetic expression and sets
   the exit status to 1 if the expression evaluates to 0, or to 0 if the
   expression evaluates to a non-zero value. You do not need to escape
   operators between (( and )). Arithmetic is done on integers. Division
   by 0 causes an error, but overflow does not. You may perform the usual
   C language arithmetic, logical, and bitwise operations. The let command
   can also execute one or more arithmetic expressions. It is usually used
   to assign values to arithmetic variables.

Listing 5. Assigning and testing arithmetic expressions

[ian@pinguino ~]$ let x=2 y=2**3 z=y*3;echo $? $x $y $z
0 2 8 24
[ian@pinguino ~]$ (( w=(y/x) + ( (~ ++x) & 0x0f ) )); echo $? $x $y $w
0 3 8 16
[ian@pinguino ~]$ (( w=(y/x) + ( (~ ++x) & 0x0f ) )); echo $? $x $y $w
0 4 8 13

   As with (( )), the [[ ]] compound command allows you to use more
   natural syntax for filename and string tests. You can combine tests
   that are allowed for the test command using parentheses and logical
   operators.

Listing 6. Using the [[ compound

[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ ( -d "$HOME" ) && ( -w "$HOME" ) ]] &&
>  echo "home is a writable directory"
home is a writable directory

   The [[ compound can also do pattern matching on strings when the = or
   != operators are used. The match behaves as for wildcard globbing as
   illustrated in Listing 7.

Listing 7. Wildcard tests with [[

[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ "abc def .d,x--" == a[abc]*\ ?d* ]]; echo $?
0
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ "abc def c" == a[abc]*\ ?d* ]]; echo $?
1
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ "abc def d,x" == a[abc]*\ ?d* ]]; echo $?
1

   You can even do arithmetic tests within [[ compounds, but be careful.
   Unless within a (( compound, the < and > operators will compare the
   operands as strings and test their order in the current collating
   sequence. Listing 8 illustrates this with some examples.

Listing 8. Including arithmetic tests with [[

[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ "abc def d,x" == a[abc]*\ ?d* || (( 3 > 2 )) ]]; echo $?
0
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ "abc def d,x" == a[abc]*\ ?d* || 3 -gt 2 ]]; echo $?
0
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ "abc def d,x" == a[abc]*\ ?d* || 3 > 2 ]]; echo $?
0
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ "abc def d,x" == a[abc]*\ ?d* || a > 2 ]]; echo $?
0
[ian@pinguino ~]$ [[ "abc def d,x" == a[abc]*\ ?d* || a -gt 2 ]]; echo $?
-bash: a: unbound variable

Conditionals

   While you could accomplish a huge amount of programming with the above
   tests and the && and || control operators, bash includes the more
   familiar "if, then, else" and case constructs. After you learn about
   these, you will learn about looping constructs and your toolbox will
   really expand.

If, then, else statements

   The bash if command is a compound command that tests the return value
   of a test or command ($?) and branches based on whether it is True (0)
   or False (not 0). Although the tests above returned only 0 or 1 values,
   commands may return other values. Learn more about these in the [37]LPI
   exam 102 prep: Shells, scripting, programming, and compiling tutorial.

   The if command in bash has a then clause containing a list of commands
   to be executed if the test or command returns 0, one or more optional
   elif clauses, each with an additional test and then clause with an
   associated list of commands, an optional final else clause and list of
   commands to be executed if neither the original test, nor any of the
   tests used in the elif clauses was true, and a terminal fi to mark the
   end of the construct.

   Using what you have learned so far, you could now build a simple
   calculator to evaluate arithmetic expressions as shown in Listing 9.

Listing 9. Evaluating expressions with if, then, else

[ian@pinguino ~]$ function mycalc ()
> {
>   local x
>   if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
>     echo "This function evaluates arithmetic for you if you give it some"
>   elif (( $* )); then
>     let x="$*"
>     echo "$* = $x"
>   else
>     echo "$* = 0 or is not an arithmetic expression"
>   fi
> }
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 3 + 4
3 + 4 = 7
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 3 + 4**3
3 + 4**3 = 67
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 3 + (4**3 /2)
-bash: syntax error near unexpected token `('
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 3 + "(4**3 /2)"
3 + (4**3 /2) = 35
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc xyz
xyz = 0 or is not an arithmetic expression
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc xyz + 3 + "(4**3 /2)" + abc
xyz + 3 + (4**3 /2) + abc = 35

   The calculator makes use of the local statement to declare x as a local
   variable that is available only within the scope of the mycalc
   function. The let function has several possible options, as does the
   declare function to which it is closely related. Check the man pages
   for bash, or use help let for more information.

   As you saw in Listing 9, you need to make sure that your expressions
   are properly escaped if they use shell metacharacters such as (, ), *,
   >, and <. Nevertheless, you have quite a handy little calculator for
   evaluating arithmetic as the shell does it.

   You may have noticed the else clause and the last two examples in
   Listing 9. As you can see, it is not an error to pass xyz to mycalc,
   but it evaluates to 0. This function is not smart enough to identify
   the character values in the final example of use and thus be able to
   warn the user. You could use a string pattern matching test such as
   [[ ! ("$*" == *[a-zA-Z]* ]]
   (or the appropriate form for your locale) to eliminate any expression
   containing alphabetic characters, but that would prevent using
   hexadecimal notation in your input, since you might use 0x0f to
   represent 15 using hexadecimal notation. In fact, the shell allows
   bases up to 64 (using base#value notation), so you could legitimately
   use any alphabetic character, plus _ and @ in your input. Octal and
   hexadecimal use the usual notation of a leading 0 for octal and leading
   0x or 0X for hexadecimal. Listing 10 shows some examples.

Listing 10. Calculating with different bases

[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 015
015 = 13
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 0xff
0xff = 255
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 29#37
29#37 = 94
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 64#1az
64#1az = 4771
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 64#1azA
64#1azA = 305380
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 64#1azA_@
64#1azA_@ = 1250840574
[ian@pinguino ~]$ mycalc 64#1az*64**3 + 64#A_@
64#1az*64**3 + 64#A_@ = 1250840574

   Additional laundering of the input is beyond the scope of this tip, so
   use your calculator with care.

   The elif statement is very convenient. It helps you in writing scripts
   by allowing you to simplify the indenting. You may be surprised to see
   the output of the type command for the mycalc function as shown in
   Listing 11.

Listing 11. Type mycalc

[ian@pinguino ~]$ type mycalc
mycalc is a function
mycalc ()
{
    local x;
    if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
        echo "This function evaluates arithmetic for you if you give it some";
    else
        if (( $* )); then
            let x="$*";
            echo "$* = $x";
        else
            echo "$* = 0 or is not an arithmetic expression";
        fi;
    fi
}

   Of course, you could just do shell arithmetic by using
   $(( expression )) with the echo command as shown in Listing 12. You
   wouldn't have learned anything about functions or tests that way, but
   do note that the shell does not interpret metacharacters, such as *, in
   their normal role when inside (( expression )) or [[ expression ]].

Listing 12. Direct calculation in the shell with echo and $(( ))

[ian@pinguino ~]$  echo $((3 + (4**3 /2)))
