### Barrel Development Best Practices

# HTML Best Practices

## Semantics
Be as semantic as possible when architecting the markup of a page. These are documents and as such should read like a document. Use valid html5 elements, referring to the spec when necessary. 

## Validate it!
Be sure to run all processed and final html through a validator to ensure clean and valid html5 markup. Use the [w3c validator](http://validator.w3.org/) to check your output either by direct copy and paste input (for local development) or by passing the url and any httpauth information.
