To start less in the tail mode (thanks to Seth Milliken for this tip), execute:
$ less +F /var/log/messages


To scroll backwards, you must first exit the follow mode by pressing Control-c. Then, you can scroll back by pressing b. In fact, all the less commands are available to you once you are in the regular less mode. You can start a search by typing / followed by the string you want to search for.
