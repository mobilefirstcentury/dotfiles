Q. How do I format date to display on screen on for my scripts as per my requirements?

A. You need to use standard date command to format date or time for output or to use in a shell script.

Syntax to specify format
date +FORMAT
Task: Display date in mm-dd-yy format
Type the command as follows:
$ date +"%m-%d-%y"
Output:
02-27-07     
Turn on 4 digit year display:
$ date +"%m-%d-%Y"
Just display date as mm/dd/yy format:
$ date +"%D"
Task: Display time only
Type the command as follows:
$ date +"%T"
Output:
19:55:04
Display localeâ€™s 12-hour clock time
$ date +"%r"
Output:
07:56:05 PM
Display time in HH:MM format:
$ date +"%H-%M"
How do I save time/date format to a variable?
Simply type command as follows at a shell prompt:
$ NOW=$(date +"%m-%d-%Y")
To display a variable use echo / printf command:
$ echo $NOW
Sample shell script:
#!/bin/bash
NOW=$(date +"%m-%d-%Y")
FILE="backup.$NOW.tar.gz"
